# SEND + MORE = MONEY

## Problem Description

This is a classic cryptarithmetic puzzle where each letter represents a unique digit from 0-9. The goal is to find the digit assignment that makes the arithmetic equation valid.

```
  SEND
+ MORE
------
 MONEY
```

## Constraints

1. **Each letter represents a unique digit**: No two letters can represent the same digit
2. **Each letter represents exactly one digit**: Every letter must be assigned a digit from 0-9
3. **Leading digits cannot be zero**: The letters S and M (which are the first digits of SEND and MONEY respectively) cannot be 0
4. **The arithmetic equation must be satisfied**: SEND + MORE = MONEY when letters are replaced with their corresponding digits

## Variables

The puzzle involves 8 unique letters: **S, E, N, D, M, O, R, Y**

## Objective

Find the unique digit assignment (0-9) for each letter such that the addition equation holds true.

## Example Format

The solution should specify the digit value for each letter, for example:
- S = ?
- E = ?
- N = ?
- D = ?
- M = ?
- O = ?
- R = ?
- Y = ?

And verify that SEND + MORE = MONEY with the found values.
